\chapter{Recommendations}

ideas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item track global x,y coordinates of cheetah. Requires depth estimating nn or distance sensor (tricky because you aren't always point at cheetah). Other option is to your height and elevation to estimate the distance
	\item get a faster camera (higher FPS)
	\item faster SBC
	\item 3-axis gimbal
	\item avoid movidius, if possible
	\item add encoder to gimbal or offset camera to avoid lining up accelerometer axis with rotation axis
	\item consider switching away from python to an even faster language with less garbage collection problems - for example, julia. Can also be low-level, now that most of the debugging/prototyping has already been done.
	\item After the network selection, the TinyYOLO architecture has been added to the list of officially support models. TinyYOLO has some grand claims about its speed, so it should definitely be evaluated as option for future work. Reducing the latency in the system would make the overall project significantly easier.
\end{itemize}

%Bad things from gimbal: hard to make screws firm+they come loose, didn't make a nice way of keeping cameras inside frame, didn't make nice spot to put pi and gimbal controller.

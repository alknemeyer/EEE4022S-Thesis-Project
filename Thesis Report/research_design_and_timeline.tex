\section{Research Problem}
narrow angle gopro with computer vision better than multiple wide angled gopros??
\section{Elaboration of the Plan of Action}
Do the minimum complete system first, then work on any extras, even if they're core to the idea of the project

Decided that training on cheetahs isn't core



\section{Description of activies, methods and software platforms}
python for pretty much all software \\
tensorflow, caffe and keras as DL frameworks \\
git to synchronize work done on pi, my laptop, VM and minibeast \\
extensive use of linux for development



\section{... validation}

\chapter{Control Loop Design and Implementation}


\section{Description of software implementation}
{\Large \color{red} thread: photo + preprocess $->$ new thread: inference result $->$ main thread. All implemented as a simple to use python class. Do the whole threading thing because (1) can't tolerate being out of the loop for 100ms+ while a photo is taken etc, and (2) because while the latency is increased slightly the FPS is increased}



\section{Benchmarking the flow of data}
{\Large \color{red} (maybe results section?) talk about the time it takes to: take a picture, pre-process the image, load it onto the NCS, get the inference result}

{\Large \color{red} the effect of python's garbage collection}

{\Large \color{red} went from $\approx 1 Hz$ to $\approx 10 Hz$ }

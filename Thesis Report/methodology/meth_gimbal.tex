\chapter{Gimbal design}

{\Large \color{red} the motors and controller that i ended up buying}

{\Large \color{red} the thinking that went into the design (what I wanted from it)}

{\Large \color{red} the resulting features }

{\Large \color{red} implementation of the serial api in python. releasing free online}

However, this design could not be used without modification as the payload for this project was more than twice the mass and size of the payload offered by this design.


\subsection{Gimbal controller}
Tuned PID controller

Rewrote SerialAPI in Python (took a while) (releasing for free online)

{\Large \color{red} talk about tuning PIDs, etc?}

\subsection{Gimbal motors}
Can increase gopro spacing etc (motors are v v strong)

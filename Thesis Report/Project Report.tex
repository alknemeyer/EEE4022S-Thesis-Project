A number of people were immensely helpful in the undertaking of this project.

Callen, thank you for your guidance, encouragement and supervision.

Justin, thank for your endless patience and advice whenever I came with questions or asking for a favour.

Stacey, thank you for laser cutting components for the gimbal. You're far too nice.

Neil, thank for proofreading an earlier version of this report. Your input was highly appreciated and raised the quality of my writing.

Sylvan, your friendship during this trying time truly saved my sanity. I'll always fondly remember working in the lab with you.

My family, your confidence in me and my abilities greatly helped keep my ambitions high and stress at a manageable level.

Sophia, thank you for your endless support and encouragement. I don't handle stress very well so our little chats helped a lot with my sanity.

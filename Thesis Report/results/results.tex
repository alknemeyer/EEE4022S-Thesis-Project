\chapter{Results}

{\Large \color{red} write intro to this section. also, anything past this text in the results section is rough rough rough}

\section{Does the thing track?}
yes, but sorta wobbly and has overshoot. delay isn't super noticeable

show like three successive photos with boxes around me




\section{Does it track for a wider range of angles than a wide-angle gopro can do? how much?}
yes!

current thing: about $180^o$ deadon, making up to $\approx 270$\textdegree\ if you count the edges

compared to gopro: up to (check) 122\textdegree

also, importantly, extending the angular range possible would simply be a case of extending cable lengths whereas the gopro has a fairly fixed max width




\section{Does it avoid wide-angle type distortion? how much?}
quantify the effects of distortion!

show two pics from the same moment: one with the gopro squeezing me into the edge of its frame with big distortion, another with me nice n centered in the tracking image

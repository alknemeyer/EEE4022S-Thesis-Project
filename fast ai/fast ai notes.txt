### KAGGLE COMPETITIONS:
    FIRST TIME: install the kaggle command line interface:
    > python -m pip install kaggle-cli
    From then on, go to competition page and accept the terms and conditions. Then, in the AWS instance:
    > kg config -g -u 'alknemeyer' -p 'MY_PASSWORD' -c 'COMPETITION_NAME'
    > kg download


### TMUX:
    Use it for things like splitting windows, etc
    > tmux
    > tmux ls           (shows tmux sessions)
    > tmux a -t 0       (gets things back as they were before. things were never shut down)
    > Ctrl+b ?          (get help)
    > Ctrl+b "          (split window vertically)
    > Ctrl+b %          (split window horizontally)
    > Ctrl+b (arrow)    (switch between panes)
    > Ctrl+b d          (detach)
    > tmux kill-server  (kills all sessions)

#### ONE TIME SETUP:
Automate login with:
    https://serverfault.com/a/241593
Set up an alias to login in + set up localhost thing:
    echo "alias paperspace-login='ssh paperspace@74.82.29.120 -L 8889:127.0.0.1:8889'" >> ~/.bash_aliases && source ~/.bash_aliases

Alias to start jupyter notebook:
    echo "alias start-jupyter='cd fastai/ && jupyter notebook --port=8889'" >> ~/.bash_aliases && source ~/.bash_aliases

### fast ai library:
    bs      batch size
    sz      image size in pixels (width == height)

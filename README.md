# EEE4022S Thesis Project

Repo to backup work for my fourth year thesis project at the University of Cape Town.

The ultimate aim of the project is to use computer vision to identify and track cheetahs from an aerial platform, such as a quadcopter. The computing power is limited (a Raspberry Pi and Movidius Neural Compute Stick) which results in slow update rates - thus, some control theory (such as an Extended Kalman Filter) may be used to ensure robust and smooth tracking.

The repo is more about backing up my work across multiple work stations, so a lot of the commit descriptions are horrible. Woops

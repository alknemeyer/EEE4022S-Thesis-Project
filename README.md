# EEE4022S Thesis Project

Repo to backup work for my fourth year thesis project at the University of Cape Town.

The ultimate aim of the project is to use computer vision to identify and track cheetahs from an aerial platform, such as a quadcopter. The computing power is severly limited (a Raspberry Pi and possibly Movidius Neural Compute Stick) which could result in slow update rates - thus, more sophisticated control theory (such as an Extended Kalman Filter) may be used to ensure robust and smooth tracking.

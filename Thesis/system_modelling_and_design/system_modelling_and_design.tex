\section{System modelling and design}

\subsection{Object detection}
\subsubsection{Intro to neural networks}
why nn instead of other cv techniques? ans: can in princple make this neural net track ANY object with high accuracy, with no extra difficult design work (just open datasets or a couple hundred hand labelled images)

Explain concept of 'learning', image classification vs object detection

CNN, transfer learning, pace of advancements is quick

How modern data science works (difference between data scientist, who designs the neural network architecture, and machine learning engineer, who tends to take existing designs, possibly modify them, and then put them into production

\subsubsection{Movidius Neural Compute stick}
required to get classification speed from $\approx 1 Hz$ to $\approx 10 Hz$

Had great difficulties. Limited choice of nn framework (tensorflow object detection isn't supported) and neural network architectures

\subsubsection{Comparison of neural network architectures}
Why I chose MobileNet (designed for applications such as mine) (can afford the accuracy loss)\\
Why I chose SSD (instead of sliding window) $\rightarrow$ inference time

\subsection{Gimbal}
\subsubsection{Intro to gimbals + their purpose}

\subsubsection{Comparison of actuator types}
servos: easy to use, but shaky

\subsubsection{Gimbal design inspirations}
The primbal from thingieverse

Sylv's mount

Some changes to make it work for my application

\subsubsection{Gimbal controller}
Tuned PID controller

\subsubsection{Gimbal motors}
Can increase gopro spacing etc (motors are v v strong)


\subsection{Extended Kalman Filter}

\subsection{Controller design and implementation}

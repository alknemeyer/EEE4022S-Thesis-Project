### DAILY WORKFLOW:

In bash:
    Update $instanceId:
    > aws-get-p2
    Start the instance (equivalent of going to GUI and then clicking start):
    > aws-start
    ssh in and create a localhost connection thingy:
    > ssh -i /home/alex/.ssh/aws-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-35-161-120-150.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -L 8888:127.0.0.1:8888
    or modify the aws alias file to include the above command under:
    > aws-ssh

    Stop the instance (ie stop billing):
    > aws-stop

In the ubuntu instance:
    See server info using:
    > nvidia-smi

    Activate notebook (note down the port number - probably :8888):
    > jupyter notebook
    Then go to web browser and enter in localhost:8888

    TMUX (use it for things like splitting windows, etc):
        > tmux
        > tmux attach       (gets things back as they were before. things were never shut down)
        > Ctrl+b ?          (get help)
        > Ctrl+b "          (split window vertically)
        > Ctrl+b %          (split window horizontally)
        > Ctrl+b (arrow)    (switch between panes)
        > Ctrl+b D          (detach)

In the jupyter notebook:
    ??<function> gives info
    <shift><tab> on function a couple times does too

Kaggle competitions:
    FIRST TIME: install the kaggle command line interface:
    > python -m pip install kaggle-cli
    From then on, go to competition page and accept the terms and conditions. Then, in the AWS instance:
    > kg config -g -u 'alknemeyer' -p 'MY_PASSWORD' -c 'COMPETITION_NAME'
    > kg download

### FIRST TIME SETUP:

First time setup. Using bash:
> sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
> pip install awscli
> aws configure
	AWS access key id:			AKIAIM7WJDHHRZJ7XEVQ
	AWS secret access key id:	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
	Location:					us-west-2
	Output:						text

> wget http://files.fast.ai/files/setup_p2.sh
> bash setup_p2.sh
Output - ie AWS setup details:
	securityGroupId=sg-37f3184a
	subnetId=subnet-0bf12443
	instanceId=i-0aa0cf477fbaf81ec
	instanceUrl=ec2-35-161-120-150.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
	Connect: ssh -i /home/alex/.ssh/aws-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-35-161-120-150.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Connect using:
> ssh -i /home/alex/.ssh/aws-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-35-161-120-150.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
See server info using:
> nvidia-smi
Allow location history:
> sudo rm .bash_history
Check notebook:
> jupyter notebook
Note down the port number - probably :8888
Go to web browser and enter in $instanceUrl + port number
eg ec2-35-161-120-150.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8888

IMPORTANT: to shut down, go to 	west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Instances
click actions > instance state > stop


Set up AWS aliases (aws-start, aws-stop, etc):
    > wget http://files.fast.ai/files/aws-alias.sh
    > nano .bashrc
    Add at end:
    > source aws-alias.sh

ask amazon for id of p2 instance
> aws-get-p2
start. equivalent of going to GUI and then clicking start
> aws-start
ssh in
> aws-ssh
AMI = Amazon Machine Image = snapshot of a computer at a particular time. In this course, we're given an AMI with python etc
shut down notebook
> ctrl+c
stop instance
> aws-stop

download notebooks (on aws instance)
> git clone https://github.com/fastai/courses.git

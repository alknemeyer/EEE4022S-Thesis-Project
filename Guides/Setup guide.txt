### BRIEF:

Now, for your vac work I would like you to get the hardware (Neural Stick + Raspberry Pi) talking to one another and then interface this to a single servo motor. This will require you getting the all the systems talking to one another. Also, getting to grips with Tensor flow and the Raspberry Pi. I’ve also bought a PI cam for the tracking

For you thesis/Final year project you will then use this to:
	Develop a single axis camera tracker for humans and dogs/cheetahs using a single servo-motor. A standard servo will work
	Develop a 3D camera tracker (using an off-the-shelf or opensource gimbal) which will first test on a static position and then mount to a quadcopter once we’re more confident.



### RASPBERRY PI 3 SETUP:

Basic headless setup:
	https://hackernoon.com/raspberry-pi-headless-install-462ccabd75d0

Enable ssh, pi camera and changed keyboard localisation using:
> sudo raspi-config

Get ip address using
> hostname -I
name:		pi
hostname:	Alex-Pi
password:	qweasdzxc
connect:	ssh pi@196.42.79.34

Set up wifi by copying wpa_supplicant.conf contents to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Get installed programs up to date:
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt upgrade
If  getting problems with "dependancy 20":
> sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf
> sudo apt update

??? Optionally change shell:
> chsh -s $(which zsh)

??? Set up no-ip for easier raspberry pi access:
    http://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/install-ip-duc-onto-raspberry-pi/


Install python and some useful libraries:
	> sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-dev
	> pip3 install numpy tensorflow keras h5py matplotlib



### MOVIDIUS NCS SETUP:

Go through these links in order:
	https://movidius.github.io/ncsdk/index.html#Introduction
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	https://developer.movidius.com/start
        > mkdir -p ~/workspace && cd ~/workspace && git clone https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git && cd ~/workspace/ncsdk && make install && cd ~/workspace/ncsdk && make examples
		"make install" takes about 2 hours to run
        "make examples" takes literally an entire working day - NOT SURE WHETHER THIS STEP IS NECESSARY

    Do tests using these links????

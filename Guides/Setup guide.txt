### BRIEF:

Now, for your vac work I would like you to get the hardware (Neural Stick + Raspberry Pi) talking to one another and then interface this to a single servo motor. This will require you getting the all the systems talking to one another. Also, getting to grips with Tensor flow and the Raspberry Pi. I’ve also bought a PI cam for the tracking

For you thesis/Final year project you will then use this to:
	Develop a single axis camera tracker for humans and dogs/cheetahs using a single servo-motor. A standard servo will work
	Develop a 3D camera tracker (using an off-the-shelf or opensource gimbal) which will first test on a static position and then mount to a quadcopter once we’re more confident.

### RASPBERRY PI 3 SETUP:
# install raspbian
1.1	download latest version of raspbian-stretch (from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). If you know your way around linux and want something more minimal, use raspbian-stretch-lite (which is what I did). However, it doesn't have a lot of the graphical libraries needed for computer vision so it requires some extra work which probably isn't worth it
1.2	flash to SD card using etcher (from etcher.io)
1.3 eject card, reinsert
1.4 copy 'wpa_supplicant.conf' and 'ssh' to the root of the home folder

# enable things
2.1	easiest way to set things up: plug in a keyboard + monitor, insert the SD card and then power the device
		(otherwise, follow the "basic headless setup" described here: https://hackernoon.com/raspberry-pi-headless-install-462ccabd75d0)
2.2	if doing the easy method, type in 'pi' as username, 'raspberry' as password
2.3	type `sudo raspi-config` to get to the raspberry configuration page
2.4	look around in the settings. Make sure to:
		enable ssh and the pi camera
		change the keyboard localisation to English (US) if shift+2 = @
		enter some basic gibberish info in the wifi setup page (to initialise it)
		change hostname from raspberrypi to something else

# set up wifi
3.1	next, connect the raspberry pi to your laptop/PC using an ethernet cable
3.2	on the raspberry pi, type `hostname -I` to get the IP address
3.3	download FileZilla, and transfer wpa_supplicant.conf (file in repo) to the home directory /home/pi
3.4	add in your username and password to wpa_supplicant.conf
3.5	on the raspberrypi, move wpa_supplicant.conf using `sudo mv wpa_supplicant.conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`
3.6 reboot the pi using `sudo shutdown -r now`

# set up noip
4.1	follow guide at http://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/install-ip-duc-onto-raspberry-pi/
4.2	type `sudo nano /etc/rc.local` and type `sudo /usr/local/bin/noip2` one line above the last one (return 0 or something)
4.3 reboot - type `sudo noip2 ­-S` to confirm noip is running on startup
4.4	now, if you need the raspberrypi ip address, you can go to `https://my.noip.com/#!/dynamic-dns` and find it there

At this point you might find it preferable to ssh into the pi from your laptop, so that you can more easily copypaste commands

# install/update software
5.1 `sudo apt update` `sudo apt upgrade`
		If getting problems with "dependancy 20": `sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf` `sudo apt update`
5.2 `sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip python3-dev cython`
5.3	`pip3 install numpy`

# install movidius in api only mode
6.1	sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
6.2 `mkdir -p ~/workspace && cd ~/workspace && git clone -b ncsdk2 https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git && cd ~/workspace/ncsdk/api/src && make && sudo make install`
6.3 download and test examples: `git clone -b ncsdk2 https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo.git && cd ncappzoo/apps/hello_ncs_py && python3 hello_ncs.py`



# installing opencv
1	sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
2	follow instructions at: https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp
3	sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libwebp.so.7 /usr/lib/libwebp.so.6 (.7 exists, .6 doesn't)
4	sudo apt-get install libtiff5 libjasper1 libilmbase12 openexr libgstreamer1.0-0
 or maybe: https://github.com/jabelone/OpenCV-for-Pi ??


### DEVELOPMENT PC SETUP
This is a bit harder to write, seeing as all versions etc will change over time. Just be aware that the latest version of everything doesn't necessarily work together - eg. tensorflow v1.9 doesn't work with CUDA v9.2 (both the latest versions at the time of writing).
Anyway, the best bet is to look at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ and follow all their instructions, making sure to install the correct versions of everything. In short:
1	Install CUDA, CuDNN
2	run:
	python -m pip install --upgrade pip
	python -m pip install tensorflow-gpu keras jupyter matplotlib
	--> Replace 'python' with 'python3' if running 'python' launches python2 for you
You can always run
	python -m pip list
to check which packages are installed, and what their versions are. 





### RASPBERRY PI 3 SETUP:

Basic headless setup:
	https://hackernoon.com/raspberry-pi-headless-install-462ccabd75d0	

Enable ssh, pi camera and changed keyboard localisation (English (US) if shift+2 = @) using:
> sudo raspi-config

Get ip address using
> hostname -I
name:		pi
hostname:	alex-pi
password:	qweasdzxc
connect:	ssh pi@196.42.79.34

Set up wifi by copying wpa_supplicant.conf contents to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Get installed programs up to date:
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt upgrade
If  getting problems with "dependancy 20":
> sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf
> sudo apt update

??? Optionally change shell:
> chsh -s $(which zsh)

??? Set up no-ip for easier raspberry pi access:
    http://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/install-ip-duc-onto-raspberry-pi/


Install python and some useful libraries:
	> sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-dev
	> pip3 install numpy tensorflow keras h5py matplotlib


### MOVIDIUS NCS SETUP:

Go through these links in order:
	https://movidius.github.io/ncsdk/index.html#Introduction
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	https://developer.movidius.com/start
        > mkdir -p ~/workspace && cd ~/workspace && git clone https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git && cd ~/workspace/ncsdk && make install && cd ~/workspace/ncsdk && make examples
		"make install" takes about 2 hours to run
        "make examples" takes literally an entire working day - NOT SURE WHETHER THIS STEP IS NECESSARY

    Do tests using these links????

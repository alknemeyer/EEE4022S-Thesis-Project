### BRIEF:

Now, for your vac work I would like you to get the hardware (Neural Stick + Raspberry Pi) talking to one another and then interface this to a single servo motor. This will require you getting the all the systems talking to one another. Also, getting to grips with Tensor flow and the Raspberry Pi. I’ve also bought a PI cam for the tracking

For you thesis/Final year project you will then use this to:
	Develop a single axis camera tracker for humans and dogs/cheetahs using a single servo-motor. A standard servo will work
	Develop a 3D camera tracker (using an off-the-shelf or opensource gimbal) which will first test on a static position and then mount to a quadcopter once we’re more confident.



### RASPBERRY PI 3 SETUP:

Basic headless setup:
	https://hackernoon.com/raspberry-pi-headless-install-462ccabd75d0

Enable ssh, pi camera and changed keyboard localisation using:
> sudo raspi-config

Get ip address using
> hostname -I
name:		pi
hostname:	Alex-Pi
password:	qweasdzxc

Set up wifi by copying wpa_supplicant.conf contents to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Get installed programs up to date:
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt upgrade
If  getting problems with "dependancy 20":
> sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf
> sudo apt update

Set up noip for easy pi access:
	Create noip account:
		www.noip.com
	Create a host. Then, install onto pi:
		https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/install-ip-duc-onto-raspberry-pi/
	Get IP from:
		https://my.noip.com/#!/dynamic-dns



Install tensorflow by following this guide:
	Get tensorflow from:
		http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-pi-zero-python3/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/output-artifacts/
	It's built by the folks who made this guide:
		https://petewarden.com/2017/08/20/cross-compiling-tensorflow-for-the-raspberry-pi/
	If you get any errors, it seems likely that it'll be due to an error with your 'protobuf' version
	--> fix by uninstalling protobuf and then letting tensorflow install the version it wants


After all this, there might be a bunch of useless files lying around. See their sizes using:
	du -sh <folder name>



### PI CAMERA SETUP:

In short:
	1. plug the camera in
	2. enable it in the Raspberry Pi configuration page:
	> sudo raspi-config
	3. install the python library:
	> sudo apt install python-picamera python3-picamera
	4. use the library (either from the command line, or the picamera library)
	   tutorial: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera



### MOVIDIUS NCS SETUP:

Go through these links in order:
	https://movidius.github.io/ncsdk/index.html#Introduction
	https://developer.movidius.com/start
		Takes a couple hours to build the core stuff:
		> mkdir -p ~/workspace && cd ~/workspace && git clone https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git && cd ~/workspace/ncsdk && make install
		Takes roughly 9 hours to build the examples + run them (not sure whether it's necessary)
		> cd ~/workspace/ncsdk && make examples

### RASPBERRY PI SERVO SETUP:
Install using:
	> sudo python3 -m pip install RPi.GPIO
Test example script using:
	> sudo python3 gpio_test.py

### JUPYTER NOTEBOOK SETUP (on working machine)
Jupyter notebook:
	> python -m pip install notebook 		(CHECK THIS)
	> jupyter notebook
Jupyter themes:
	https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes
	> python -m pip install jupyterthemes
	> python -m pip install --upgrade jupyter
	> jt -l
	> jt -t oceans16
	or:
	> jt -t onedork -fs 95 -altp -tfs 11 -nfs 115 -cellw 88% -T



### COPY FILES:
From pi to local pc:
	> rsync -avz --progress -e ssh pi@196.42.79.34:/home/pi/python_scripts /home/alex

From local pc to paperspace instance:
	> rsync -chavzP --stats /path/to/local/storage paperspace@74.82.29.120:/home/paperspace/thesisproject/data

to do:

1. go through fast ai course, revise everything and try rebuild stuff in keras
2. read paper on dropout
3. get keras visualisation working? https://keras.io/visualization/



keep in mind:

options for localisation:
1.  idea:
        return (confidence, x, y) as outputs of network
    pros:
        probably most efficient
        simplest
        highest resolution
    issues: 
        what happens when there are multiple objects?

2.  idea:
        run classification network multiple times over portions of the image
    pros:
        could run in parallel on NCS
        solves multiple objects problem
        might be all the resolution I need
    issues:
        complex
        probably more compute intensive
